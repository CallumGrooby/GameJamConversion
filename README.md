# GameJamConversion

Developed with Unreal Engine 4

Known issues with built
- Unfixable issues
-- Dont store repos on one drive
-- Use visual studio 2019 (im using 16.11.5) (will cause issues if you dont)
-- When loading the build on personal PC or Lab PC it will ask to rebuild the project because Lab unreal is classed as a diffrent version (Ryan sent a message about it on moodle)
you can rebuild it in place (if youve made changes make a back up)


Bugs
- Cant drop items,
